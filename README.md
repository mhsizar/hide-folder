# hide-folder

The Hide Folder, a Rust CLI application, will allow users to hide/unhide user-specified directories on Windows computers by hiding/unhiding them from the deviceâ€™s file manager. Users will be prompted to select hide or unhide a folder and provide the path to the directory. The application will use the Windows API to implement the hide/unhide attributes matching the request of the user.
